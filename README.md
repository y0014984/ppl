    <strong>PROJECT DISCONTINUED</strong>
    <br/>
    <strong>========================================</strong>
</p>

**PPL** my second attempt of creating a mod for Arma 3. The main goal is to save players actual loadout on serverside for reuse in later events. Even half empty magazines are saved and later restored.

The project is entirely **open-source** and all contributions are welcome. Feel free to maintain your own custom version, so long as the changes you make are open to the public in accordance with the ([APL-SA](https://www.bistudio.com/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike)).

## Features

- Save loadout templates from actual player loadouts.
- Load templates into players loadouts.
- Rename and delete templates.
- Load active loadout automatically an event start.
- Save active loadout automaitcally on disconnect or mission end. (manual save is also possible)
- User management (only admins can administer and assign templates)
- Loadout saved on server only.

## Installation

Download the latest versions of PPL, CBA_A3 and INIDBI2 and unpack them in your Arma 3 and Arma 3 server installation folders.
Simply launch Arma 3 with `-mod=@CBA_A3;@PPL` and Arma 3 server mith `-mod=@CBA_A3;@PPL -servermod=@INIDBI2` afterwards.
