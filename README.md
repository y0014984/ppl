**PPL** my second attempt of creating a mod for Arma 3. The main goal is to save players actual loadout on serverside for reuse in later events.

The project is entirely **open-source** and all contributions are welcome. Feel free to maintain your own custom version, so long as the changes you make are open to the public in accordance with the ([APL-SA](https://www.bistudio.com/community/licenses/arma-public-license-share-alike)).

## Features

- Load and save gear on a per player basis.
- Load gear from templates.

## Installation

Download the latest versions of PPL, CBA_A3 and INIDBI2 and unpack them in your Arma 3 and Arma 3 server installation folders.
Simply launch Arma 3 with `-mod=@CBA_A3;@PPL` and Arma 3 server mith `-mod=@CBA_A3;@PPL -servermod=@INIDBI2` afterwards.
